New data sources make it possible to quantify human behavior, especially on social media. For example, the structures of social networks can be captured with high precision, and over time, content such as texts, but also images, can be categorized and linked to people or social reactions. Only recently, Article 40 of the Digital Services Act mandated access to such data for research in the European Union, and several platforms have already (re)opened their access in response. When such data is linked to individuals' survey responses, it becomes a powerful tool to describe, for example, the relationship between online behavior and political attitudes. Furthermore, online platforms enable a variety of novel experiments, e.g. through browser add-ons that change parts of the online environment or game-based approaches to study collective behavior. With these methods, we aim to cover the spectrum between experimental control and ecological validity in the study of human behavior online.
