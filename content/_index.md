        SynoSys is Complexity Science. The spirit and perspectives that Complexity Science offers pervade the Center, its people and their activities. 
        We investigate phenomena that seem unrelated at first glance. Yet, we seek and search for underlying rules that connect them. 
        We have an anti-disciplinary attitude, we are neo-generalists, we transcend the borders of traditional disciplines. We explore, 
        we do science with a compass, rather than a map. We get lost in science.</div>

  #       The central research questions are: How is public discourse shaped by social networks and sorting algorithms, and how does it benefit certain rhetoric? How do generated images affect attention and emotions and how do they reinforce certain narratives more than others? Establishing causality between these factors in such complex socio-technical systems is an overarching challenge that we aim to address.
  #       <br>
  #       To achieve this, we are convinced that looking at those systems from various angles is crucial. While the overarching questions span the whole research groups, we are composed of a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and methods. Digitalization is not only impacting social systems, but also expanding the methods for studying them and enabling us to cover a spectrum of measurements of human behavior between micro and macro levels, ranging from online experiments to field studies in social media and large-scale platform data analysis, while computer simulations may help connect the scales.

In this research area we aim to establishing causality between such information environments and factors that are crucial for democracy, such as institutional trust, affective polarization or support for populists, which is a challenge in such complex socio-technical systems."

          content: "Here, our research focuses on Digital Propaganda, which we understand as orchestrated efforts to influence the public, by personalizing and repeating messages, simplifying complex issues into narratives, and employing emotionally charged content. We ask the question of how digitalization has changed those strategies and how they influence beliefs, attitudes, and behavior."

          content: "Natural Language Processing (NLP) has come a long way, and now researchers can analyze text data in ways that were impossible just a few decades ago. Social media posts, transcripts of political debates, and parliamentary speeches are now valuable data sources for studying human behavior, political discourse, and societal trends. This opens up a bunch of new questions and gives us new ways to study them."
