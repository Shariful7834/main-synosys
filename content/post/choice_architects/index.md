In this multi-author paper, spearheaded by [Friederike Stock](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/person/friederike-stock/419405), and as part of the [Junior Researcher Program](https://jrp.pscholars.org/) with young researchers from 26 different countries and the project was supervised by Philipp Lorenz-Spreen. Little is known about who users themselves think should control their online environments, and under what circumstances. In our preregistered study, participants across 26 countries (N = 11,686) decided between combinations of three possible choice architects—governments, platforms, and individuals—and three objectives—societal, commercial, and personal—in seven real-world contexts. Across all countries, people strongly prefer to set their own rules for their online choice architectures. Find the full preprint [here](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/haqu9).
