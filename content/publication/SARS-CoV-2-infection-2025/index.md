abstract: "Understanding the factors associated with persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to improving long-term health outcomes. Using a wearable-derived behavioral and physiological dataset (n = 20,815), we identified individuals characterized by self-reported persistent fatigue and shortness of breath after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with symptom-free COVID-19 positive (n = 150) and negative controls (n = 150), these individuals (n = 50) had higher resting heart rates (mean difference 2.37/1.49 bpm) and lower daily step counts (mean 3030/2909 steps fewer), even at least three weeks prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, persistent fatigue and shortness of breath were associated with a significant reduction in mean quality of life (WHO-5, EQ-5D), even before infection. Here we show that persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with pre-existing lower fitness levels or health conditions. These findings additionally highlight the potential of wearable devices to track health dynamics and provide valuable insights into long-term outcomes of infectious diseases."
