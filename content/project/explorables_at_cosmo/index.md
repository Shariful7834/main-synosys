The interdisciplinary research center [Department Speculative Transformation](https://dst-tud.de/) of TUD Dresden University of Technology launched the "Designing Futures Together: Visionary Realities" (https://dst-tud.de/visionary-realities-exhibition/) at the [Cosmo Science Forum](https://www.cosmo-wissenschaftsforum.de/). The exhibition was open from April to Juli, 2024. We provided an interactive visualization exhibit with a selection of [Complexity Explorables](https://www.complexity-explorables.org). Have a look at what people saw at the exhibition.
