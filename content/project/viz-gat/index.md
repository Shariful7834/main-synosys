This interactive visualization illustrates the worldwide air-transportation network. The network connects approx. 4000 airports globally with roughly 51.000 connections. On this network more than 3 billion passengers travel each year. In total, humanity travels a total distance of over 15 million kilometers every day (under normal conditions), that is roughly three times the radius of our solar system.
